# Python Cookie Stealer
The Python cookie stealer is a tool that can be used in penetration testing and XSS attacks to steal browser cookies from victims. The tool works by setting up a server that listens for incoming requests with a specific cookie value. When a request is received, the tool logs various information about the request, including the date and time, client IP address, user agent, referer, and cookie value, to a file.

This tool can be used by attackers to steal sensitive information, such as session tokens and authentication credentials, from unsuspecting users. By stealing a user's browser cookies, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's account and perform actions on their behalf.

## Usage

1. Clone Python Cookie Stealer Project
```
git clone https://github.com/TheWation/PythonCookieStealer
```

2. Install Python and FastAPI on your machine if you haven't already. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install FastAPI using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi
```
3. Install uvicorn, a lightning-fast ASGI server, using pip:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

4. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using a terminal or command prompt.

5. Create a new file called main.py and copy the FastAPI code into it.

6. Start the FastAPI server by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

7. In your web browser, visit http://localhost:8000/c/your-cookie-value, replacing your-cookie-value with the value of the cookie that you want to log. For example, if the cookie value is ABC123, you would visit http://localhost:8000/c/ABC123.

8. The server will log the date and time, client IP address, user agent, referer, and cookie value to the cookies.txt file in the project directory.

```

9. The server will also return a response with a status code of 200 if the request was successful, or a status code of 500 if there was an error writing to the file.

10. You can repeat step 6 with different cookie values to log additional data to the file.

11. To stop the server, press CTRL+C in the terminal where it is running.
